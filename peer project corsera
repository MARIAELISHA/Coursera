To solve this prediction assignment using R, follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Data Preparation
```R
# Load necessary packages
library(caret)

# Download and load the training data
train_url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
training <- read.csv(url(train_url))

# Download and load the test data
test_url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
testing <- read.csv(url(test_url))
```

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
```R
# Explore the structure and summary statistics of the training data
str(training)
summary(training)
```

Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
```R
# Remove unnecessary variables/columns
cols_to_remove <- c("X", "user_name", "raw_timestamp_part_1", "raw_timestamp_part_2", 
                    "cvtd_timestamp", "new_window", "num_window")
training_clean <- training[, !names(training) %in% cols_to_remove]

# Remove near-zero variance predictors
nzv_cols <- nearZeroVar(training_clean, saveMetrics = TRUE)
training_clean <- training_clean[, !nzv_cols$nzv]

# Handle missing values
training_clean <- training_clean[, colSums(is.na(training_clean)) == 0]

# Perform feature scaling/normalization
preProc <- preProcess(training_clean[, -ncol(training_clean)], method = c("center", "scale"))
training_scaled <- predict(preProc, training_clean[, -ncol(training_clean)])
```

Step 4: Model Building and Evaluation
```R
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Split the training data into training and validation sets
inTrain <- createDataPartition(training_clean$classe, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
train_data <- training_scaled[inTrain, ]
valid_data <- training_scaled[-inTrain, ]

# Train a model using an appropriate algorithm (e.g., random forest)
model <- train(classe ~ ., data = train_data, method = "rf")

# Evaluate the model on the validation set
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = valid_data)
confusionMatrix(predictions, valid_data$classe)
```

Step 5: Final Model Training and Testing
```R
# Train the final model on the entire training dataset
final_model <- train(classe ~ ., data = training_scaled, method = "rf")

# Prepare the test data for prediction
testing_clean <- testing[, !names(testing) %in% cols_to_remove]
testing_clean <- testing_clean[, !nzv_cols$nzv]
testing_scaled <- predict(preProc, testing_clean[, -ncol(testing_clean)])

# Make predictions on the test data using the final model
test_predictions <- predict(final_model, newdata = testing_scaled)
test_predictions
```

#Step 6: Report and Submission
- Create an R Markdown document to describe the steps performed, the model building process, and the evaluation results.
- Include explanations of the choices made during data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
- Compile the R Markdown document into an HTML report.
- Upload the report to a GitHub repository, preferably in a branch named "gh-pages," so that the HTML page can be viewed online.
- Submit the link to the GitHub repository for peer review.
- Finally, use the trained model to predict the outcomes for the 20 test cases provided in the test data and submit your predictions to the Course Project Prediction Quiz.
